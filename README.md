### Features & Design

#### Frontend

- React Framework for frontend build
- :bar_chart: [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library used for graphing portfolio breakdown, company financials, and asset price history
  - Doughnut chart of portfolio holdings
  - View all company financial charts available through HyperCharts (e.g., revenue segments, cash flow, etc...)
  - View historical stock and crypto prices by time range
- :currency_exchange: [money.js](https://openexchangerates.github.io/money.js/) library used for currency conversion (see backend below for exchange rate API)
- :telescope: Search functionality for stocks and crypto assets
- :brain: Financial and price data cached to limit API calls
- :cow: [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework
- :clipboard: Asset portfolio persists in local storage. Database ( MongoDB) currently in development to make this application full stack ðŸ¥ž.

#### Backend

- :dog2: Fetches data from the following APIs:
  - [HyperCharts API](https://hypercharts.co/api-docs) for company financials
  - [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/) for stock and crypto price history
  - [Yahoo Finance](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/) for stock ticker search, current stock price, and exchange rates
  - [Coin Cap API](https://docs.coincap.io/) for crypto symbol search
  - [Nomics API](https://nomics.com/docs/) for current crypto price
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) library for server/routing
- [express-slow-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-slow-down) library (middleware for express) to slow down requests to Nomics API, which has a 1 request per second rate limit
- [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) library (middleware for express) for adding CORS headers to responses
